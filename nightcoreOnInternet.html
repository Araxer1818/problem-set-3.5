    <h2>How Did Nightcore Get on the Internet?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Although Nightcore hasn't exploded until the addition of "All I want for Christmas" and "Into the Sky", but Nightcore's transition to the Internet started in around 2006 where the first uploaded Nightcore track was "Dam Dadi Doo". Nightcore's transition to Youtube started in 2008 where the user "Maikel621" uploaded around 30 original by Nightcore and indicated as one of the first users to post Nightcore on Youtube.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What Impacts Did Nightcore Have on Society?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>By the mid-2010s many music artist and PC Music founders who have listened to Nightcore have very different, but positive opinions on Nightcore. Based on interviews with different artists who have listened to Nigthcore before have stated that the High-Pitched voices and the upbeat tubes have made them feel emotional in their head rather than having the voices sound like an interaction with another human being. Additionally, other music artists say that this type of music is inescapable, and it is stated that this type of music can be described as "too catchy, and far too much fun to not welcome into the dance music mainstream".</li>
