    <h2 class="question">Who started and coined the term "Nightcore"?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">The duo that has started and coined the termed Nightcore were by Steffen Ojala Søderholm, which is the guy on the right in black and whites, and Thomas S. Nilsen, and his picture is on the right below Steffen's.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="question">Where and when did Nightcore Begin?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">The term "Nightcore" was first used with the duo's stage name, DJ SOS and DJ TNT respectively, and their use of the word "Nightcore" was supposed to mean "we are the core of the night, so you'll dance all night long", with their website stating "Nightcore is Hardcore". </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="question">What was Nightcore during that time?</h2>
        <img class="creator2" src="images/Thomas_Nilsen.jpg" alt="This is a picture of Thomas Nilsen">
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">During the time Nightcore was used by the 2 DJ's, Nightcore wasn't the usual high-pitch sped up music like it was today. It usually only sped up Eurodance or trance type songs sped up by 25% to reach a beat around 160 to 180 beats per minute. Nightcore is usually compared to happy hardcore and bubblegum bass because of their very similar characteristics in beats and vocals in music. </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="question">Why was the term "Nightcore" created?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">The term "Nightcore" was created because it was first used as the duo's stage name. They chose this name because they both like the pitch-shifted music in German group Scooter's hardcore songs. Due to the lack of artist similar to Scooter's type song, the duo decided to create Nightcore as a style of music as a way to "make the music happier".</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="question">How did Nightcore start to grow to what is it today?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="answer">Although there wasn't really any search of Nightcore on the Internet and because the duo generally kept their work a secret only to their area, it wasn't until 2011 and 2012 where Nightcore was able to grow again where users uploaded "All I want for Christmas" and "Into the Sky" onto Facebook where more users then began to search and create more Nightcore focused music. </li>
      </ul>
