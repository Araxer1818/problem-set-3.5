          <ol>
            <li>The first quick way to identify if a song is Nightcore is if the cover is a picture something related to anime. This happens because the voice sounds like someone from an anime is singing the song and so the picture is going to have to go along with this type of genre in music.</li>
              <p></p>
            <li>The second identification is if the song is sped up from 10 to 30% and the pitch is increased to a point where it sounds an anime girl or boy is singing it. The voices in Nightcore is usually the main component of what identifies a song be a "Nightcore".</li>
              <p></p>
            <li>Although it is not necessary, it is common for a Nightcore song to be switching vocals or be in a mix in with many other different songs. It is usually very identifiable if a song is considered "Nightcore" because it is usually stated on the title with name of the original song.</li>

Nightcore is considered to be remixed versions of music with more upbeat tunes, higher pitched vocals and sped up music. Nightcore was first coined by two people who are Steffen Ojala Søderholm and Thomas Nilsen. Nightcore didn't start growing in popularity until users started to upload their own versions on Nightcore on the internet.
        After that Nightcore started to show an increase in searches and popularity. Finally, Nightcore is the most common version of its kind, but there are other types of Nightcore that can consist of switching vocals, Nightstep, or Daycore/Anti-Nightcore.</p>
